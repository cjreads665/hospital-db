init.sql will be the initial script that will run every time sql table is run/created.
We import a library called pino that helps us create a logger for our Node.js application.

We create a new logger using pino and store it in a constant variable named log. This logger will help us keep track of what happens in our application.

Inside the logger configuration, we make the following choices:

base: {pid: false}: We decide not to include the "process ID" (PID) in the logs. The process ID is a unique number given to each running program, but we don't need it in our logs, so we turn it off.

transport: {...}: This option allows us to specify where the logs should be sent or how they should be formatted. In this case, we use the "pino-pretty" transport target, which makes the logs pretty and colorful when they show up on the screen. The options property inside transport allows us to customize how the "pino-pretty" output looks. Here, we set colorized: true to make the logs colorful.

timestamp: () => ","time": "${new Date.toLocalString()}": This part is a custom function that sets the format of the timestamp in the logs. A timestamp shows the date and time when each log entry is generated. In this case, we use a JavaScript Date object to get the current date and time, and we format it to our liking.

Finally, we export the log variable so that we can use the same logger throughout our application. Any file in our app can now import log and use it to write logs.

In summary, this code sets up a logger using pino for our Node.js application. The logger is configured to make the logs pretty, colorful, and easy to read with the "pino-pretty" transport target. By exporting the logger, we can use it in different parts of our app to keep track of what's happening and better understand its behavior.
